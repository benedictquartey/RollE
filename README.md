# RollE [Affordable Modular Autonomous Vehicle Development Platform]

Every year, 1.27 million people die in road accidents, 90% of which are down to human error. In 2015 there were 256,179 victims in Africa alone. RollE is an open-source programme to develop modular self-driving cars in a collaborative manner. Students and researchers have access to this technology to test their ideas and implement algorithms for autonomous driving, using learning and control techniques which are similar to those used in the automotive industry, but without having to take on the elevated relative costs.
